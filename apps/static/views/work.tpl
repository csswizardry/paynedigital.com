    <p>Much of the work I undertake is on behalf of agencies and as such
    it is not always possible to divulge full project details (often including
    the name of the end-client), but as much information about each piece
    of work is given.</p>

    <p>This page also highlights a selection of my own projects, most of which
    are freely available on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

    particular order.</p>
