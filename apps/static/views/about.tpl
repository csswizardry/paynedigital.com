{block name='body'}
    <p>With a BSc Hons degree in Software Engineering my primary skills lie in
    a range programming languages&mdash;primarily PHP, JavaScript, Objective C and
    less recently C plus plus&mdash;as well
    as their commonly associated data stores: namely MySQL, MongoDB and more
    recently Redis. I also have many years&rsquo; experience administering unix-like
    systems from dedicated source-control servers, all-in-one LAMP stacks
    and dedicated load-balanced clusters.</p>

    <p>In typical web parlance I am a &lsquo;backend&rsquo; developer though
    the distinction between front and back end is not one I am fond of; 
    <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com">this website itself</a>
    involves a number of best-practice &lsquo;frontend&rsquo; techniques
    such as use of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, HTML5 APIs, CSS3, Responsive
    Design and a sprinkling of progressive enhancement using JavaScript&mdash;none
    of which conform to traditional &lsquo;backend&rsquo; expectations, though
    none of which would make me consider myself a frontend developer.</p>

    <p>I have a passionate interest in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">&lsquo;Real-time web&rsquo;</a>,
    in particular how it can be leveraged in tandem with HTML5 and associated technologies to
    make immersive online multiplayer games using only a user&rsquo;s browser. I
    am also a fervent supporter of open source software having contributed
    to numerous projects and having a <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew?tab=repositories">diverse portfolio
    of my own work</a> online.</p>

    <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you&rsquo;d like to speak to me directly.</p>
