{block name='body'}
    <p>Payne Digital Ltd was founded in 2010 in order to provide specialised Web Application
    and Mobile development. You won&#8217;t find a &#8216;meet the team&#8217; page just yet
    because it would be rather thin on the ground; at present Payne Digital only has one 
    employee&mdash;<a title="Hi there! My name's Nick Payne" href="http://twitter.com/makeusabrew">me</a>.</p> 

    <p>Don&#8217;t let that put you off&mdash;I work with a number of talented individuals
    and companies to provide a full range of online services from Website Design &amp; Build, right up
    to full <a href="http://faavorite.com" title="faavorite is a great example of a full scale web application">Web Application development</a>
    and Mobile Application development. I also have a passionate interest in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">&lsquo;Real-time web&rsquo;</a>,
    in particular how it can be leveraged in tandem with HTML5 and associated technologies to
    make immersive online multiplayer games using only a user&rsquo;s browser.</p> 

    <p>I also offer Software Development consultancy &amp; training&mdash;please see
    a more thorough <a href="/services">list of services</a> for more information, or by all means
