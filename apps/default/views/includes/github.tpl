<p>You might be interested in checking out some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew">GitHub</a>.
You'll even find <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com">this website</a> on there.</p>

<p>My most active open source project is the <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss">jaoss</a>
<a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-web-template">framework</a>, which you can find more about at <a href="http://jaoss.org">jaoss.org</a>
(which, funnily enough, is also available <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-website">on github</a>)!</p>
