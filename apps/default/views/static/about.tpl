    </div>
    <p>Payne Digital Ltd was founded in 2010 in order to provide specialised Web Application
    and Mobile development. You won&#8217;t find a &#8216;meet the team&#8217; page just yet
    because it would be rather thin on the ground; at present Payne Digital only has one 
    employee - <a title="Hi there! My name's Nick Payne" href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/nick-payne/4/1a1/214">me</a>.</p> 

    <p>Don&#8217;t let that put you off &#8211; I work with a number of talented individuals
    and companies to provide a full range of online services from SEO to Website Design, right up
    to full Web Application development and Mobile Application development.</p> 

    <p>You&#8217;ll probably notice the use of the royal &#8216;we&#8217; around the rest of
    the site. That&#8217;s not me being pretentious (this page wouldn&#8217;t exist if it was
    &#8211; it&#8217;s just easier that way. Honest.</p>
